B3R Tree Implementation
------------------------
📋 Description
This repository contains the implementation of a B3R Tree in order to store integers, a data structure that combines the properties of balanced trees and red-black trees to optimize operations like search, insertion, and deletion.

🚀 Features
Insertion: Add keys while maintaining balance.
Search: Efficient key lookup.
Deletion: Remove keys while preserving tree balance.
Maximum: Get the highest key stored in the tree.
Minimum: Get the lowest key stored in the tree.
Visualization: Graphical representation of the tree.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Language: Java.
Paradigm: Object-Oriented Programming.
